Views collaboration allows to see users that are seeing/editing/updating the current opened record.

== Overview

If you open a record at the same time as another user, their profile picture will appear to the right
of the record's toolbar.

By default, a green border surrounds the profile picture. This means that the user is simply consulting the record.

If the user is editing the record, the border turns orange.

If the user saves their changes, the border turns red: the data on your page is no longer
up to date with the database and you may need to refresh your page.

On groups, there is a boolean `canViewCollaboration` to determine whether members
can view collaboration (`true` by default).

== Limitation

Only records displayed on top form are supported. Popup and others record rendering aren't supported.
