Custom Themes can be defined for applications by creating css file
`css/<theme-name>/theme.css` under `src/main/webapp` directory of the application
source.

An example theme `css/blue-simple/theme.css` is provided with the {page-component-title}.

The base theme is based on the bootstrap2 css. You can customize most
aspect of the theme by overriding default bootstrap css rules.

Other {page-component-title} related css rules mostly follows the standard bootstrap design
so most of the time overriding bootstrap css rules automatically applies to the
custom css rules.

== Rules

The most important custom css rules are related to form view widgets. They are
defined in `view.form.css` file.

The most import rules are:

- `form-item-container` - applied to widget container
- `form-item` - applied to field widget
- `form-label` - applied to label widget
- `display-text` - applied to field text on readonly widget
- `<widget-name>-item` - css class for a widget (e.g. string-item)
- `readonly` - if field is readonly
- `required` - if field is required

== Highlight

The highlight feature can be used to apply custom css dynamically based on
some condition. The feature can be used to highlight grid view row/cell or form
view fields.

predefined highlight classes:

- `hilite-primary`
