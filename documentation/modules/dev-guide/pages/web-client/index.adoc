:toc-title:

The web client is developed using the following web technologies:

. angular.js - modern JavaScript framework
. bootstrap - CSS framework
. jquery - the famous JavaScript library
. jquery.ui - the missing UI library

The {page-component-title} web is the only and official frontend application included with
the {page-component-title}.

The web app is generic enough to cover most needs.
Most of the time, developers only need to work on XML views, actions, and server-side Java code.

However, in case advanced web app customization is needed, it is possible to create themes, add custom JSP templates, and register static web resources in order to customize the UI.
