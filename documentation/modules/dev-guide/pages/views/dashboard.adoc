The dashboard is used to provide overviews. The dashboard view is composed of
dashlets.

<dashboard name="welcome.dashboard" title="Welcome!">
  <dashlet action="chart:chart.sales.per.month"/>
  <dashlet action="chart:chart.sales.per.month.pie"/>
  <dashlet colSpan="12" action="sale.orders"/>
</dashboard>

Dashlets are nothing but embedded views. Right now, `grid` and `chart` views
are supported.

The dashlet `action` can be either an action view or `<view-type>:<view-name>`
value. Right now, only `grid`, `chart` and `custom` views are supported.
