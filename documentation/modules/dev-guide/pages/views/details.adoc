The master-details view shows grid and form views side-by-side as single view. It can be defined
using `action-view` using a view parameter `details-view`.

<action-view name="team.tasks.all" model="com.axelor.team.db.TeamTask" title="Tasks">
  <view name="team-task-grid" type="grid" /> <1>
  <view name="team-task-form" type="form" /> <2>
  <view-param name="details-view" value="true" /> <3>
</action-view>

<1> the grid view used by this action
<2> the form view used by this action
<3> `details-view` params configures grid view to show details view on right side

We can also provide alternative form view by specifing view name as `details-view` param value,
