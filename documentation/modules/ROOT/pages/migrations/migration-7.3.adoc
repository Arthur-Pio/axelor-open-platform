In this document, we will see the major steps to migrate from 7.2 to 7.3.

NOTE: Please check the {product-version-changelog}[change log] for detailed list of fixes, changes and improvements introduced in 7.3

== Gradle upgrade

The Gradle version has been upgraded from 8.7 to 8.11. This upgrade brings performance improvements and bug fixes.

To migrate, run the wrapper update:
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 8.11
----

NOTE: The workaround previously suggested for Gradle issue https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/22921 (xref:migrations/migration-7.1.adoc#dependencies-upgrade[described in 7.1 migration guide]) is no longer needed since Gradle 8.9. If you had implemented this workaround, you can safely remove it.
