In this document, we will see the major steps to migrate from 7.0 to 7.1.

== Dependencies upgrade

Some dependencies have been upgraded to newer versions. Check the {product-version-changelog}[change log] for detailed
list.

NOTE: Please check the {product-version-changelog}[change log] for detailed list of fixes, changes and improvements
introduced in 7.1

Gradle has also been upgraded to a newer version. Upgrade the Gradle Wrapper to benefit from new features and
improvements : `./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 8.6`.

[NOTE]
====
Note that running the wrapper task once will update `gradle-wrapper.properties` only, but leave the wrapper itself in
`gradle-wrapper.jar` untouched. This is usually fine as new versions of Gradle can be run even with ancient wrapper
files. If you nevertheless want all the wrapper files to be completely up-to-date, youâ€™ll need to run the `wrapper`
task a second time.
====

Check Gradle migration to update your builds :

- `7.5` -> `8.0` : {gradle-7-5-8-0}[Upgrading your build from Gradle 7.x to 8.0]
- `8.0` -> `8.6` : {gradle-8-0-8-6}[Upgrading your build from Gradle 8.x to the latest]

[NOTE]
====
Gradle can display such warning : `Path for java installation '/usr/lib/jvm/openjdk-11'
(Common Linux Locations) does not contain a java executable`. It seems that Gradle will
continue to show this message if the environment is fine.
