title: Support view-param popup reload on dashlets
type: feature
description: |
  ```xml
  <view-param name="popup" value="true"/>
  ```

  Open dashlet edit in popup (instead of new tab).
  (This is currently for grid dashlet only. Other dashlet types always open popup.)
  After closing, dashlet has up-to-date data for the record that was opened and edited.
  (Search request may be performed by some dashlet types to achieve that result,
  but it's room for later improvement.)

  ```xml
  <view-param name="popup" value="reload"/>
  ```

  Reload current tab after closing popup from dashlet.
  If the tab is dirty before opening the popup,
  save confirmation dialog is shown before proceeding.
