title: Change code generator strategy to merge item attributes
type: change
description: |
  Previously, the code generator replace the field definition by the new one. Now 
  the code generator will merge initial field attributes with overridable attributes.
  So, only necessarily attributes that need to be override should be defined in the 
  overwritten entity.
  
  This applies to both entities and enums.

  In the case of entity fields, there are a few restrictions:
    * Attributes that are not overridable:
      * `initParam`
      * `column`
      * `column2`
      * `ref`
      * `mappedBy`
      * `table`
      * `tz`
      * `json`
    * Attributes that are overridable with some conditions:
      * `large`: large field cannot become non-large
      * `transient` and `formula`: persisted field cannot become non-persisted
