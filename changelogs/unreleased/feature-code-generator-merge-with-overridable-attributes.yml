title: Generate code with merged item attributes instead of completely replacing them
type: feature
description: |
  This applies to both entities and enums.

  In the case of entity fields, there are a few restrictions:
    * Attributes that are not overridable:
      * `initParam`
      * `column`
      * `column2`
      * `ref`
      * `mappedBy`
      * `table`
      * `tz`
      * `json`
    * Attributes that are overridable with some conditions:
      * `large`: large field cannot become non-large
      * `transient` and `formula`: persisted field cannot become non-persisted
