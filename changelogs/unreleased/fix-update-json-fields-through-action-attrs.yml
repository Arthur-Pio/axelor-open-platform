title: Fix update custom fields
type: fix
description: |
  This fixes updating custom fields in views. 
  Custom field that are part of the default `attrs` json field can be updated either without prefix 
  (`<attribute for="test" name="value" expr="eval: "some""/>`) or without prefix 
  (`<attribute for="attrs.test" name="value" expr="eval: "some""/>`), no matter where the action is triggered in the 
  view. This means that whether the action is triggered from a field event or a button in the main form or from a field 
  event or button inside a json field, it works same. For custom fields that are part of other json fields, they have 
  to be updated with their respective prefix : `<attribute for="myOtherJsonField.test" name="value" expr="eval: "some""/>`.
  Both `action-attrs` and `action-record` are supported.
