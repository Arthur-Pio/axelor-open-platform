title: Fix parsing field widgetAttrs to preserve type depending on attribute
type: fix
description: |
  Extra widget attributes doesn't takes into account the type of each attributes. 
  This result of some unexpected behaviors. For example, the `x-true-text="true"` 
  cause error on `BooleanSelect` widget.
  Depending on the attribute, the value is converting to the right type.
