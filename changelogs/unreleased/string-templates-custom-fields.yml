title: Allow access to custom fields in StringTemplate via dotted notation
type: feature
description: |
  StringTemplate doesn't allow `$` character in expressions. This is the way we use to access custom field
  from context : `$extraAttrs.myCustomField`. Accessing custom fields need to be prefixed by the related
  json field name (ex: `<SaleOrder.extraAttrs.myField>`or `<SaleOrder.attrs.anotherField>`). For custom fields
  in default `attrs` field, it is not needed to use prefix (ex: `<SaleOrder.myField>` ). However, it is
  recommended to always use the related json field name as prefix.
