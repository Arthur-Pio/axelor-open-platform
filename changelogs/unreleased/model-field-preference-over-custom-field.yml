title: Model field preferred over custom field when setting value
type: change
description: |
  When a custom field has same name of model field, action called from 
  form view was updating field in form but action called from json editor 
  was updating field in the json editor. This was creating confusion 
  depending on where the action was called. To uniformize behavior, form 
  field gets preference over custom field (if same name). This can be 
  breaking change, but use a custom field name same a model field one isn't 
  recommended.
