title: Add view customization permission on Group and `view.customization` application configuration
type: change
description: |
  All users used to be allowed to customize views, and only admins could share.
  Now, view customization permission is checked on Group, and can be set to "Not allowed" (default),
  "Can customize", or "Can share".
  `view.customization` application configuration defaults to `true`.
  If set to `false`, Customize menu and custom views are disabled.
