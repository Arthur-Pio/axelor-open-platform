title: Check for permissions on dotted fields
description: |
  Check for permissions on dotted fields:

  * Filter permitted dotted fields in fetch request
  * Filter permitted dotted fields in search request
  * Filter permitted fields in ActionRequest.setValue
  * Check create/write permission on related fields in save request
  * Check write permission on editable grid
  * Hide dotted fields if user has no access at all
  * Hide dotted fields in editors if user has no access at all

  Users are still permitted to read dotted fieldsâ€™ id, version, and namecolumn
  regardless of permissions.

  Dotted fields are not hidden if there are conditional permissions,
  but are shown empty if user has no permissions and check is still performed in save request.
type: security
