title: Implement phone widget with react-international-phone
type: feature
description: |
  Widget is supported on form and grid view.
  The phone widget renders the field as a phone number link in readonly mode,
  and as a phone number input with a country/region selector in edit mode.
  
  Compared to implementation in previous front-end,
  `x-custom-placeholder` option is no longer supported.
