title: Implement support to see users on same view in realtime
type: feature
description: |
  This allows to see users that are seeing/editing/updating the current opened record.

  Feature can be disabled with `view.collaboration.enabled` property. By default, it is enabled.
  On groups, there is a new boolean `canViewCollaboration` to determine whether members
  can view collaboration (`true` by default).
