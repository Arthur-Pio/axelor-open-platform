title: Add /files/data-export?fileName and /files/report?link endpoints
type: feature
description: |
  Add files endpoints accepting filename as query param instead of path param.

  This ensures URIs are ASCII only, complying with Shiro InvalidRequestFilter.

  Files endpoints using filename as path param are kept for backward compatibility and may be removed
  in later versions.
