title: collection editor without x-viewer no more used in readonly
type: change
description:
  For collection fields, if the editor isn't marked with `x-viewer="true"` 
  and doesn't have any viewer defined, the editor is no more used in readonly 
  mode. The default rendering behavior will be used instead (ie grid). This 
  is more consistent with others fields behavior.
