title: Rework actions on chart menu
type: change
description: |
  Adding buttons on chart menu was working using the following syntax :
  `<config name="onAction" value="some-action"/>`
  
  This syntax has been updated to the following :
  ```
  <actions>
  <action name="myBtn1" title="My action 1" action="some-action1"/>
  <action name="myBtn2" title="My action 2" action="some-action2"/>
  </actions>
  ```
  
  This allows to support more than 1 button on chart menu, but also
  provide a flexible usage of the feature.
