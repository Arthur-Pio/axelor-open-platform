title: Improve tabs rendering
type: fix
description: |
  Instead of hiding tab on unselect or deactivate by seleting different tab,
  Then it will use visibility:hidden style instead of display: none.
  Visibility will keep container height/width, so no re-calculation of style
  on select or activate.
