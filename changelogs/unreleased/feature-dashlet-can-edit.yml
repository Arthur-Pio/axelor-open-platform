title: Add `canEdit` atttribute to `panel-dashlet`
type: feature
description: |
  The new `canEdit` attribute on `panel-dashlet` will control whatever we can edit
  dashlet records even if the dashlet is in readonly. By default, when a `panel-dashlet`
  is in readonly (or main view is readonly mode or top container element is readonly),
  the record will be opened in popup. We can't edit the records. If editable, the record
  will be opened in a new tab, in readonly mode. We can then switch to edit mode to edit the record.

  Few more improvments :
  * Show file icon in grid dashlet when in readonly mode
  * Show pencil icon in grid dashlet when editable
  * Fix ignored dashlet attributes in dashboard
