title: Fix truth value of action test expressions
type: fix
description: |
  When evaluating action test expressions, "expr" should have the same truth value as "!!expr".

  It was working with types boolean, integer, date, time, datetime, enum, references (any-to-one),
  but was failing with long, decimal, string, binary, collections (any-to-many).
