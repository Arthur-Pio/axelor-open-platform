title: Allow canMove sequencing on any field specified by orderBy
type: feature
description: |
  With `canMove`, the field used for sequencing does not have to be a field named `sequence`
  anymore, but can be any field specified by `orderBy`.

  Sequencing is done on field specified by `orderBy`, and it must be only one integer field.
  If not specified, not sequencing is done.

  On top-level grid, `canMove` requires `orderBy`.
