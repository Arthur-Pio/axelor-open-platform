title: Use whole value comparisons in datetime searches instead of using `between` operator
type: fix

  PostgreSQL JDBC driver 42.2.3+ introduce a change on how Timestamp are rounded : 
  https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/1211
  
  For example, `2018-06-03T23:59:59.999999999` is rounded to `2018-06-04 00:00:00`
  Previously `2018-06-03T23:59:59.999999999` was rounded to `2022-03-08 23:59:59.999`
  
  If nanoseconds is greater than 999999500 , value is now rounded. This is how PostgreSQL works :
  ```
  $ insert into some_table(date) VALUES('2018-06-03 23:59:59.999999999');
           date            
  ----------------------------
  2018-06-04 00:00:00
  ```
  
  The `between` operator used when searching on date/dateTime in UI have been updated to use 
  `>=` and `<` operators instead.
