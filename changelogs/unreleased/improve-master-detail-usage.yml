title: Improve MasterDetail usage
type: feature
description: |
  MasterDetail form is no more displayed by default, but only when a line is selected and we want to create new record from.
  Also, when we add a new record, cancel current edit or click on back button, MaterDetail form is hidden.
  Add a new button "Add and new" to allow pushing current record in grid and quickly create a new one.
