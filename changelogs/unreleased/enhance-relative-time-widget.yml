  Relative time widget now displays `Date` data fields in a more
  readable format: 'Today' if date is today, 'Tomorrow' if date is tomorrow,
  'Yesterday' if date is yesterday, 'dddd' (day name) if date is within next week,
  'Last dddd' if date is within last week, and as `DateTime` otherwise.
  
  Also provide support in grid/tree views as well as in formatter.
