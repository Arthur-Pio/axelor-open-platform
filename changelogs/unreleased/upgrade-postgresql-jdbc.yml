title: Upgrade PostgreSQL JDBC driver from 42.7.1 to 42.7.2
type: security
description: |
  SQL injection is possible when using the non-default connection property 
  `preferQueryMode=simple` in combination with application code that has a 
  vulnerable SQL that negates a parameter value.
  
  See https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1597

  As we are using the default query mode, we aren't impacted. But administrators 
  can still change the JDBC URL themself to use the impacted query mode.
