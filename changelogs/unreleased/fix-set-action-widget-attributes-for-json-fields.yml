title: Fix set custom fields attributes
type: fix
description: |
  This fixes updating custom fields attributes in views. 
  
  Custom field that are part of the default `attrs` json field, attributes can be updated either without prefix 
  (`<attribute for="test" name="hidden" expr="eval: true"/>`) or without prefix 
  (`<attribute for="attrs.test" name="hidden" expr="eval: true"/>`), no matter where the action is triggered in the 
  view. This means that whether the action is triggered from a field event or a button in the main form or from a field 
  event or button inside a json field, it works same.
  
  For custom fields that are part of other json fields, attributes have to be updated with their respective prefix 
  (`<attribute for="myOtherJsonField.test" name="hidden" expr="eval: true"/>`) or if the action is executed inside the 
  json field, attributes can also be updated without prefix (`<attribute for="test" name="hidden" expr="eval: true"/>`).
