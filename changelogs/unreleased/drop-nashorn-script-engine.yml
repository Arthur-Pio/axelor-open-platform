title: Replace nashorn script helper with GraalJS engine
type: change
description: |
  The nashorn script engine is deprecated in JDK-11 and has some
  incompatible changes than JDK-8.
  
  The new implementation uses GraalJS which supports latest ECMAScript features.
  
  The collection helpers `listOf`, `setOf` and `mapOf` are removed as corresponding
  native JavaScript objects are passed with appropriate Java equivalent wrapper to the
  Java calls.
