title: Disable translation joins on queries by default
description: |
  Add Query.translate() and Filter.translate() to enable translation joins.

  REST API now accepts parameter `translate` to enable translation joins
  on criteria and for ordering, but never for domains.

  Web client always uses the `translate` parameter.
