title: Improve kanban UI/UX
type: feature
description: |
  Kanban columns can now be collapsed. An 'x-collapse-columns' property
  has been added, accepting a comma-separated list of column names that
  should be collapsed by default (reference fields not supported). This 
  comes with other visual changes such as pagination and minor fixes.
