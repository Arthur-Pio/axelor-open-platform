title: Improve support of `X-Forwarded-*` headers
type: feature
description: |
  App is now having full support of `X-Forwarded-*` headers and provide 
  better usage of proxy management.
  
  Supported headers are : `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Port`, 
  `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Prefix`, `X-Forwarded-For`.
  
  Note that now `X-Forwarded-Prefix` is used instead of `X-Forwarded-Context`.
  
  This avoid custom proxy configuration to rewrite the location or cookie path.
