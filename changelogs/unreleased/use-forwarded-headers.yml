title: Improve support of `X-Forwarded-*` headers
type: feature
description: |
  App now have full support for `X-Forwarded-*` headers and provides
  better usage of proxy management.
  
  Supported headers are: `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Port`, 
  `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Prefix`, `X-Forwarded-For`.
  
  pac4j usage is now based on the current request. When redirecting urls, 
  the Location is now absolute and no more relative to current servlet path.
  This avoids custom proxy configuration to rewrite the location or cookie path.
