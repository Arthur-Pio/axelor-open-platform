title: Implement client-side sorting of o2m/m2m grids
type: feature
description: |
  When there were some pending changes on a grid, sorting used to be disabled.
  This is no longer the case thanks to client-side sorting.
  Also transient/dummy fields can now be sorted.
  Only o2m/m2m grids can be sorted client-side.
  Other grid views that use pagination still send search request upon sorting.
