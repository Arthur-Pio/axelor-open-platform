title: Fix update from value to no value on grid row
type: fix
description: |
  Issue happened in two cases on o2m grid.

  First one is when changing from a m2o record that has a translation
  to another one that has no translation. Translation from previous record was wrongly kept.

  Second one is when changing from a m2o record that has a dotted value
  to another one that has no dotted value. Dotted value from previous record was wrongly kept.
