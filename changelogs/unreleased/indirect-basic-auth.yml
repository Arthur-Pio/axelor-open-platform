title: Support indirect/direct basic auth client via setting `auth.local.basic-auth`
type: change
description: |
  Indirect basic auth allows to log in on callback, while direct basic auth requires credentials in each request.

  ```properties
  # enable indirect and/or direct basic auth
  auth.local.basic-auth = indirect, direct
  ```

  `auth.local.basic.auth.enabled`, which was for direct basic auth only, is removed.
