title: Always retain filters in grid view action context
type: change
description: |
  On actions executed from grid views, we can fetch current filters applied 
  on the view using `request.getCriteria()`. it was initially only available if 
  there are no records selected. To be consistent, it should also be available 
  whatever records are selected or not. This shouldn't have any impact. Selected 
  records are available thought `_ids` in context, the current filter through 
  `request.getCriteria()`.
