title: Field names used by the create on the fly
type: change
description: |
  The create on the fly feature control by the `x-create` attribute 
  is used to quickly create records and/or pre-filled values base on 
  the current search input.
  
  Previously, any fields named `code`, `name` and the namecolumn of 
  the object were filled by default. This is no more the cases: only 
  the field names provided in the `x-create` attribute will be.
