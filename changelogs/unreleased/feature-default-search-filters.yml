title: Add `view-param` named `default-search-filters` to apply filters by default
description: |
  Example:

  ```xml
    <view-param name="search-filters" value="filter-sales"/>
    <view-param name="default-search-filters" value="confirmed,highValue"/>
  ```

  Filters named `confirmed` and `highValue` will be applied by default.
  For that usage, use new attribute `name` for each `filter` in `search-filters`.
