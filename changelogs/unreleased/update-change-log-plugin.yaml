title: Allow to generate empty changelog release
type: fix
description: |
  If no changelog entries are found, there is no changelog release generated. This 
  is the default behavior. New properties `allowNoEntry` and `defaultContent` can 
  be used to determine if it is allowed to generate changelog without entries and 
  to specify the changelog release content (for example, `No notable changes`).
