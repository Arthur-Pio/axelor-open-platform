title: Format numbers, dates, and currencies preferably according to the user language
type: change
description: |
  Formatting of numbers, dates, and currencies used to be based on browser locale only.
  Now, formatting is done preferably according to the user language.
  If the user language has no country information, we select the first browser locale
  that matches the user language.
