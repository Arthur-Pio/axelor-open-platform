title: Add application setting to disable permission check on relational fields
type: feature
description: |
  Use `application.disable.relational.field.permission = true` to disable permission checking on relational fields.
  That setting severely breaks security. It should be used with extreme caution and as a last resort only.
  It will be removed in the future.
