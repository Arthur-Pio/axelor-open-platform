title: Display notification if the audit log isn't available for an entity
type: feature
description: |
  Entities with `logUpdates="false"` doesn't have change tracking enabled. So the 
  `created(On|By)` and `updated(On|By)` fields aren't available. When showing audit log popup,
  rely on `createdOn` field to check if change tracking is available for the entity. If not, 
  display a notification instead of showing a popup with empty data.
