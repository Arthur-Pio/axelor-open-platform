title: Remove hibernate search support
type: remove
description: |
  We removed Hibernate search support (Full text search). The implementation was very basic and haven't
  been followed and improved since the initial implementation.

  Following properties aren't used anymore and can be deleted from properties file :
  
  * `hibernate.search.default.directory_provider`
  * `hibernate.search.default.indexBase`
  
  We are actively working on a new integration that will provide much more power and a better integration 
  in daily usage. Stay updated for the announcement in a future version.
  
  There is no replacement. Advance search feature can be used in order to achieve same goal.
