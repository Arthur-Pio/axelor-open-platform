title: Remove ability to switch tenants after authentication
type: remove
description: |
  At the initial stage of the multi-tenant implementation, it was allowed 
  for a user to switch tenant. It was a convenient for testing and debugging.
  At this point it doesn't seems to good option anymore, due to security risk 
  and goal of multi-tenant. So the feature has been removed and no replacement 
  is expected. `db.%tenant%.roles` property has been removed.
