title: Refactoring menu and tags processing
type: feature
description: |
  This is a refactoring on how menus and tags are processing. The original way was complex and mixing tags 
  and menus rules in a single method. There is no changes on how it works.
  
  Now, menus and tags processing are separate. Moreover, instead of parsing each menu one by one (but also recursively 
  checking parent access), it builds a tree. The tree is a representation of the menus' hierarchy, where each menu have 
  a parent and some child's. Then the tree is traversed, checking each node access. When a node is allowed, it 
  continues traversing each child's. When a node is not allowed, it skips the node and all the child's.
