title: Fix file upload when using filename pattern
type: fix
description: |
  Property `file.upload.filename.pattern` should be evaluated on each upload
  in order to evaluate `{year}`/`{month}` or `{day}` keys.
  Moreover, when using a custom filename pattern, `{name}` should be placed at
  the end of the pattern. If omitted, he is appended by default at the end.
