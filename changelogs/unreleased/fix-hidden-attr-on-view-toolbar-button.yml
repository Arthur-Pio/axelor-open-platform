title: Fix hidden/readonly attr on view toolbar button
type: fix
description: |
  When hidden="true" is set on menubar item or toolbar button it should hide the item or
  when readonly="true" is set on item, it should make item readonly.
  Currently hidden/readonly is only working when any of showIf/hideIf/readonlyIf is also defined on item.
