title: Fix checking permissions on export
type: security
description: |
  When exporting data, it should check permissions on each fields. 
  For example, when exporting `currency.symbol`, it should first check 
  if user can export `currency` field in `Order` entity, then if user 
  can export `symbol` field on `Currency` entity.
