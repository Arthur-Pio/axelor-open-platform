title: Fix wrong translated value when changing m2o in grid row
type: fix
description: |
  Issue happened on a grid row record, if a m2o has a translated target name.

  When changing it to another value without a translation and after committing,
  translation from previous value was shown instead. It appears as if m2o hadn't changed,
  because we still see translation from previous value.
