title: Add `x-dirty` attribute to view fields
type: feature
description: |
  If the view field is marked as `x-dirty="false"`, the
  field value change will not mark current record dirty.
  
  The old dirty checking behavior of the `$` prefixed
  fields is now deprecated and will be removed during
  next major release.
