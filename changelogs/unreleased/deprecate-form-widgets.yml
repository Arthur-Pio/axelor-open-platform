title: Deprecate legacy form layout in favor of panel layout
type: deprecate
description: |
  Form widgets `<notebook>`, `<break>`, `<group>`, `<portlet>`, and `<include>` are deprecated.
  `cols` and `colWidths` form attributes used for legacy form layout are also deprecated.
  Those will be removed in the next major version. Use panel layout instead.
