description: |
  This add support new `SCRAM-SHA-256` password encryption method which is  
  now the default password encryption method is PostgreSQL 14.
  
  Jdbc also introduce a change about Timestamp rouding : 2018-06-03T23:59:59.999999999 is rounded to 
  2018-06-04 00:00:00 (previously it was rounded to 2022-03-08 23:59:59.999). This new behavior follow psqlâ€™s suit.
  Especially if you work with Datetime/Timestamp having `LocalTime.MAX` as time, make sure to adjust your query.
