title: Use Gradle Node Plugin to run npm tasks
type: feature
description: |
  No more need to install Node.js locally to build web resource bundles, aka `npm-build` task.
  
  If your project already depends on `gradle-node-plugin`, there will be conflicts between both. As the provided plugin 
  is only applied on root project, the best fit is to delegate the process to a subproject. That way, the subproject 
  can process and build your needs, and the root project can depends on that subproject and gets produced build.
  
  To use it, you need to Declare Node.js repository in `settings.gradle`, section `dependencyResolutionManagement` : 
  ```gradle
    // Declare the Node.js download repository
    ivy {
      name = "Node.js"
      setUrl("https://nodejs.org/dist/")
      patternLayout {
        artifact("v[revision]/[artifact](-v[revision]-[classifier]).[ext]")
      }
      metadataSources {
        artifact()
      }
      content {
        includeModule("org.nodejs", "node")
      }
    }
  ```
