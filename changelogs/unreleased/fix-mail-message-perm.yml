title: Fix mail message permission requirements
type: anomaly
description:
  We should not need to give permission to `MailMessage` to access the mail menus and to remove one’s messages.
  `MailMessage` actions are now always allowed in order to open mail views.
  A new REST endpoint `messageRemove` is used to remove one’s messages.
