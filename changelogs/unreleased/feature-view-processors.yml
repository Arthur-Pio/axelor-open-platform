title: Add view processors for processing views
type: feature
description: |
  View processors allow to programmatically add view widgets.
  They are automatically discovered on application startup,
  and they are executed in module resolution order,
  after finding view in `MetaService::findView`,
  which is used by `view` API endpoint.

  Example:

  ```java
  public class MyViewProcessor implements ViewProcessor {
  
    @Override
    public void process(AbstractView view) {
      // Do something to the `view`.
    }
  
  }
  ```
