title: Fire PreRequest and PostRequest events outside of transactions
type: change
description: |
  `PreRequest`/`PostRequest` events are now fired outside of transactions.
  This fixes accessing the created/update records in a multithreaded process from `PostRequest` observers.
  However you can no longer rollback the request process in a `PostRequest` observer.
