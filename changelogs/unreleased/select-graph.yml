title: Add support to fetch graph with save and fetch requests
type: feature
description: |
  We can now pass `select` map to the `save` and `fetch` requests
  to return object graph. If `fields` and `related` options are also
  given, they will be merged with the graph.
  
  The format of the `select` map is as follow:
  
  ```json
  {
   ...
   "select": {
     "name": true,
     "customer": {
       "name": true
     },
     "items": {
       "product": {
         "name": true
       },
       "quantity": true
       "price": true
     }
   }
  }
  ```
