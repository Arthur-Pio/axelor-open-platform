title: Don’t trigger popup’s onLoad upon closing
type: fix
description: |
  When a popup was closing when saving the record, onLoad actions was triggered.
  This is unnecessary as the popup will be closed in all was. It was also
  causing errors because the actions results was applied on a closed popup/form.
