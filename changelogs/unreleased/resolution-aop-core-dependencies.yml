title: Improve resolution of AOP core dependencies
type: change
description: |
  Use AOP version defined in root project. This avoids to use a version
  coming from transitive dependencies.
  
  For example, if a module is built and published using AOP version 6.1.2
  and the root project use AOP version 6.1.1, it will now use the AOP
  version of the project, ie 6.1.1 (instead of getting the AOP version of
  the transitive dependency of the module).
